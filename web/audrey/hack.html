<p>This page explains how I got a Korn shell
running on my Audrey. It was a pain in the neck, but now the work is done and it
ought to be easier from this point on.</p>

 <b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is an overview of what I did:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Get an Audrey flash ROM image on disk from
    someone who knew someone who apparently serviced Audreys, and had a Compact
    Flash card that was used to restore Audreys to their original state. Without
    this image, I would have probably gotten nowhere.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Using the QNX RTP, dump the contents of the
    Audrey filesystem to disk.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Add pterm, ftp, and a clever web page to my
    local copy of the Audrey file collection.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regenerate the embedded filesystem.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Put the filesystem back on the Audrey image,
    and flash it back to the Audrey.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let the Audrey auto-update itself back to
    the 1.02.08.01 final version.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Run the shell and explore!</font></li>
</ol>

 <b>Detail</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">This should be enough detail for a determined person to
do what I did:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Get a bunch of equipment ready:<br>
    <br>
    At least one 32-meg CF card.<br>
    CF-to-Type II adapter, or some way to plug your CF card into a PC. I have a
    laptop running Linux, so I use the Type II slot on it.<br>
    Power strip with a switch. This is important because otherwise you'll have
    to unplug your Audrey about 3,000 times in a brief period of time, and I bet
    it'll break if you do that.<br>
    Null modem cable that fits the Audrey's serial port on one end, and one of
    the serial ports on your PC.<br>
    A PC running <a href="http://get.qnx.com"> QNX RTP</a>. It's free for
    noncommercial use and it's a really cool OS.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li>Get an Audrey flash ROM image. For me it involved some luck.
    Unfortunately, I can't pass it along to you. That was the one condition of
    my receiving it. I hope you understand that I can't give it out, so please
    don't ask -- I will ignore any e-mail that contains a request for the image.
    But if someone else has an image and wants me to post a link to it, e-mail
    me at the address below and I'll put the link on this page.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Break the image into its parts (I'll refer to the original file by the
    filename audrey.cf):<br>
    <br>
    0x00000000 - 0x0007FFFF: audrey.boot, the QNX Neutrino microkernel plus
    bootloader.<br>
    0x00080000 - 0x00F3FFFF: audrey.fs, the QNX embedded filesystem containing
    the Audrey files.<br>
    0x00F40000 - 0x01000000: audrey.rom, the VGA bios and IPL (image program
    loader) that's a combination of 3Com and QNX code.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Copy audrey.fs to the QNX PC and mount it:<br>
    <br>
    devf-ram -u2 -b5 -r -s0,16m,0,16m,128k &amp;<br>
    dd if=/root/audrey.fs of=/dev/fs0p0<br>
    flashctl -v -p/dev/fs0p0 -n/flash -m<br>
    <br>
    At this point you have the Audrey filesystem mounted at /flash on your QNX
    PC. Copy it into a new location (so that you can manipulate it). I'll assume
    you put it in ~/audreyfs.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Create a mkefs build file, or just use mine, which I
    called ~/audrey.build <i>(Note: I think that this file has to be in Unix
    text file format -- if you have carriage returns in it by editing in on
    Windows, it'll get confused and give you stupid error messages. This cost me
    only about a week of my life)</i>:<br>

  <li>For some stupid reason, I couldn't get the QNX microkernel files to mount
    at /proc/boot, so I just copied them into my local mirror on the Audrey
    filesystem:<br>
    <br>
    cd ~/audreyfs/nto/bin<br>
    dumpifs -x -b ~/audrey.boot<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Add in some new files. I chose the following:<br>
    <br>
    nto/photon/bin/pterm<br>
    nto/photon/config/pterm/psh.rc<br>
    nto/photon/config/pterm/pterm.rc<br>
    nto/photon/.ph/pterm/pterm.rc -- I can't figure out why I had to put in two
    copies of pterm<br>
    nto/bin/ftp<br>
    nto/bin/qtalk<br>
    kojak/CGI/shellex <i>This file fell out of the sky but you can write one
    yourself if you have a version of QNX that can compile for libc.so.1. It's
    just a CGI binary that takes the QUERY_STRING environment variable and hands
    it to /bin/sh. It needs to have its permissions set +s.</i><br>
    data/XML/shell.shtml <i>This is the clever web page I talked about earlier.
    Here's the source for it.</i><br>
    <br>
    &lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;title&gt;Shell&lt;/title>&lt;/head>&lt;body><br>
    &lt;!--#exec cmd=&quot;shellex $QUERY_STRING&quot; --><br>
    &lt;/body>&lt;/html><br>
    <br>
    There's a whole bunch more stuff you could conceivably put in there, but
    unless you're concerned about inefficient use of the filesystem, this will
    be sufficient because you can ftp the rest of the stuff you need to the
    system.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Make the new embedded filesystem:<br>
    <br>
    cd ~/audreyfs<br>
    mkefs ../audrey.build ../audrey_sowbug.fs<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>At this point you have an &quot;enhanced&quot; Audrey filesystem. Recreate
    the flash image using the <a href="ehack.zip">tools</a> I wrote:<br>
    <br>
    cat audrey.boot audrey_sowbug.fs &gt; audrey_sowbug.img<br>
    mkcf audrey_sowbug.img audrey_sowbug.cf 32047104<br>
    <br>
    <i>Note: 32047104 is the size of the CF card that I have. Find out the size
    of yours by dd'ing the card to a file and seeing how big the file turns out
    to be.<br>
    <br>
    </i></li>
  <li>Flash the CF file to the CF card:<br>
    <br>
    dd if=audrey_sowbug.cf &gt; /dev/hde<br>
    <br>
    Note: /dev/hde is where my laptop mounts the CF card. Yours may be
    different.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Flash the Audrey! Turn it off, put in the CF card, hold down the datebook
    and power buttons, and turn the power back on. Follow the instructions on
    the screen.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Get to the web browser and type in this URL:<br>
    <br>
    http://localhost/shell.shtml?pterm<br>
    <br>
    At this point, a terminal window should pop up. You now <b><i>0wN</i></b>
    your Audrey!<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="ys_scroll_normal_down.gif" width="43" height="35">
 <b>To do</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>My symbolic links are screwed up, and I can't see the default channel
    page. I need to fix the audrey.build file to get this right, because ln
    explodes when I try it in the shell on the Audrey.</li>
  <li>Slinger, the miniature web server on the Audrey, can be configured to
    listen on all addresses. If you're willing to deal with the security risk,
    do this by editing this line in /config/rm-apps:<br>
    <br>
    rb,/kojak/kojak-slinger, -c -e -s -i 127.1<br>
    <br>
    to this:<br>
    <br>
    rb,/kojak/kojak-slinger, -c -e -s<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to rebuild the QNX kernel. This seems to require some
    information that I don't have (basically, the ELF header of the startup
    program, and a library for at least one of the executables in the kernel).
    It may be that I can just use the stuff included with the QNX RTP, but I'm
    concerned that there's some interaction with the top of the ROM -- the BIOS
    that lives there is a custom job done by 3Com, QNX, or a third party that
    sold them the BIOS.</li>
  <li>Rewrite the Audrey-specific drivers in the QNX kernel. If I do this and
    solve the kernel build issues, then it'll be possible to distribute all the
    tools to allow other people to pull their images off their Audreys. This is
    the Holy Grail of creating a&nbsp; <b><i>completely legal</i></b>
    independent Audrey development community, because a person will be able to
    do everything I've listed here with nothing but legally redistributable
    files (QNX RTP and rewritten drivers).</li>
  <li>Add libc.so.2 to my image. This is a requirement for doing future
    development under the QNX RTP -- presently, it's not possible to build
    anything under that system that relies on libc.so.1 instead of libc.so.2.
  </li>
  <li><b><i>Get some sleep!</i></b> I have been getting about 4 hours of sleep
    every night over the last two weeks, and working at my normal job during the
    day. I need rest!<br>
  </li>
