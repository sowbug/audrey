\fi-360\li360\tx360 Games and Accessories\par
\pard A number of games and accessories are now made available on the system. Minesweeper has been written from scratch for Audrey and put together with the capability to launch it and other applications from the browser.\par
Here are some important URLs that need to be book-marked for your convenience in accessing these applications:\par
\par
Minesweeper : http://localhost/launch.shtml?ms\par
Peg : \cf1\ul http://localhost/launch.shtml?peg\cf0\ulnone  -x 0 -y 0\par
Othello : \cf1\ul http://localhost/launch.shtml?othello\cf0\ulnone  -x 0 -y 0\par
pterm : \cf1\ul http://localhost/launch.shtml?pterm\cf0\ulnone  -x 0 -y 0 \par
phcalc: \cf1\ul http://localhost/launch.shtml?phcalc\cf0\ulnone  -x 0 -y 0 \par
\par
pterm provides a root ksh on the unit allowing you access to ftp, telnet, and other unix like commands. Beware if you accidentally delete or rename existing files on the unit you can easily break the system and can only recover by re-installing the firmware. As usual you can exit the shell by giving the command\par
# exit\par

\fi-360\li360\tx360 CompactFlash Card Support\par
\pard If a DOS Formatted CompactFlash card is inserted into the unit, Audrey will format it for it\rquote s use and copy all the email mailboxes, Web Links and Address and Date Book data to the CompactFlash card. All data will be now be read/written to/from the CompactFlash card rather than the Audrey internal Flash file system. \par
\par
Note a bug exists that means the unit must be switched off before removing the CompactFlash card, otherwise the unit crashes. The DOS Audrey.000 file written on the CompactFlash card can be copied to a PC as a backup of all your Audrey Data.\par
\par
Note: Audrey uses 4Mbytes of the CompactFlash card for it\rquote s storage.\par
\par
This feature  has been brought to you mainly by Harry Bryson with the User Interface work done by Keith Manning.\par
 \par
\pard{\pntext\f1 8.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf1\pnindent360\pnstart8\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\tx360 UK Timeservers\par
\pard The Timeservers on the unit for the SNTP Time service have been changed to\par
\par
Filename : /config/Timeserver0 contains : nto0.ja.net\par
Filename : /config/Timeserver1 contains: ntp0.strath.ac.uk\par
Filename : /config/Timeserver2 contains: hail.pdd.3com.com\par
\par
These haven\rquote t been tested as the 3Com firewall prevents access to the SNTP port number for this service. If they need to be changed just launch a shell (pterm) as shown below and give the command:\par
# echo sntp.time.server > TimeserverX\par
where sntp.time.server  is the name of the new timeserver you wish to use, and X is 0, 1, 2 in the order in which you wish to access  the timeserver. I.e. if Timeserver0 fails after 30 secs Timeserver1 is used etc.\par
\par
This release is the last brought to you by the Edinburgh IAD team who wish you many happy years with the now discontinued Audrey.\par
