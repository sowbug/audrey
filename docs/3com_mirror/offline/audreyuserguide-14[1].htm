<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The Actions Palette is the control center for Audrey. It gives you access to an editing panel (cut, copy, and paste) that allows you to move information within and between applications, a screen capture tool (called &quot;snapshot&quot;), and printing features. It also features configuration options for the Datebook, Browser, Mail, and Channels applications, and general Audrey options, such as connectivity settings, the screen calibration utility, and volume adjustment.</FONT></p>

<P><IMG SRC="audreyuserguide-27.gif" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="295"></p>

<p><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">To launch the Actions Palette, press the Actions Palette button located to the right of the screen.</FONT></B>

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The Actions Palette has options that depend on which application is running when the Actions Palette is launched. If the Browser is open and then you launch the Actions Palette, it would look the same as always, with the exception that there would be a browser options icon immediately to the left of the Audrey options icon. This is true of the Datebook, Mail application, and Channels, but not the Address Book. The Actions Palette is the only application besides the Address Book, which can be exited by pressing its button while it is open. Like other applications, it can also be exited by launching any other application.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">When you tap this button, any text that has been highlighted with the stylus is cut out of the current application and placed in the internal clipboard. The text can then be pasted into another application by tapping to place the cursor and then tapping <B>paste</B>, or the text can simply be deleted by not pasting it anywhere.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This button allows you to make a screen capture from the currently open application. Here's how:</FONT></p>

<P><OL><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>Launch the Browser by pressing the <B>Browser</B> button on the console.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>Once your default home page loads, press the <B>Actions Palette</B> button. Then tap <B>snapshot</B>.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>A screen appears instructing you to &quot;tap and drag to capture the snapshot&quot;. At this point, you can either tap cancel to quit or tap okay to continue. Tap <B>okay</B>. The Actions Palette disappears and you see the main Browser window with its default home page loaded.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>Using the stylus, tap to the left and above any object on the screen. Then drag the stylus (never losing contact with the screen) to the right and below the object. Notice that a black box appears around the area you have selected. Lift the stylus.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>The Actions Palette launches again, showing you what you have just captured. At this point you can tap cancel to exit this screen capture session, tap try again to return to the Browser window and repeat step<B> </B>4, or tap okay to add this image to your snapshots archive in the Address Book application. Tap <B>okay</B>.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B><LI></B>The Address Book opens to its snapshots state. Here, you can title the snapshot, add a note about the image, and select options for adding it to the Address Book and/or a new e-mail message. If you decide to add the message to the Address Book, you will need to enter a title for the image. If you decide to add the image to a new mail message, the Mail application will launch to a new composition with the image attached as a file. Once you have made your selections, tap <B>done</B>.</FONT></P></OL>

<P><A NAME="P461_65660"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">print</FONT></B><br>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This button is grayed out unless you have connected a compatible USB printer (such as the Canon<SUP>TM</SUP> BJC-85W) to one of Audrey's USB ports. If you have a printer installed, you can tap this button to print out an image of the currently open application window. Visit <B>3Com.com/ergo</B> for a list of compatible printers.</FONT></P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The button to the immediate left of the Audrey options button changes depending on the application that is open when the Actions Palette is launched.</FONT></B>

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This button will show options for the Datebook, Browser, Mail, and Channels when launched with those options open. It will appear blank when the Actions Palette is launched with the Address Book open. The following is an overview of the application buttons and the options they provide.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">When you launch the Actions Palette with the datebook application running, a datebook options button appears to the left of the Audrey options button.

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">When you launch the Actions Palette with the Audrey Channels running, a channel options button appears to the left of the Audrey options button. Tap the<B> channel options</B> button and you will be taken to a configuration screen for the currently loaded channel. If you have a channel running but you don't see a channel options button when you launch the Actions Palette, that channel does not have configurations options.</FONT></P>

<IMG SRC="audreyuserguide-31.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="54">

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">When you launch the Actions Palette with the Browser application running, a browser options button appears to the left of the Audrey options button. Tap the <B>browser options</B> button to see a screen offering options for configuring your browser's home page, cookie rules, cache clearing, and font settings. Navigate this screen using the menu bar in the upper right corner of this screen. The following is an overview of these options:</FONT></p>

<p><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>home page</B> This is the default option when you tap the browser options button. Here you can set the home page (the page that loads as soon as you launch the Browser application) two different ways. You can either drag the stylus across the URL currently in the text field and then type a new URL or you can simply tap <B>insert current page</B> to make the currently loaded page your new home page.</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>cookies </B>Tap this menu item and you will see two radio buttons. Tapping the radio button next to &quot;Accept all cookies&quot; sets the Browser to receive cookies from Web sites. Tapping the radio button next to &quot;do not accept cookies&quot; will prevent your browser from receiving these files. If you make changes here, tap okay; otherwise tap cancel.</FONT></P>

  <UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>NOTE: </B>Cookies are small files, which allow Web pages to remember what you've seen already, and tailor your experience to suit you. The advantage of cookies is they allow you to see where you've been before. The disadvantage of cookies is they allow Web sites to analyze your browsing behavior.</FONT></P>

</UL>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>cache</B> Tap this menu item and you will see two radio buttons. Tapping the radio button next to &quot;clear cache&quot; will delete downloaded files in the Browser application's cache.

If you make changes here, tap okay; otherwise tap cancel.</FONT></P>

  <UL><P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>NOTE: </B>The cache is the place where text and images downloaded from the Internet are stored to make re-loading pages quicker.</FONT></P>

</UL>

<li><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>Fonts</B> Tap this menu item and you will see three radio buttons, each corresponding to a different font size (small, medium, large).
