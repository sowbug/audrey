If requested, this information must be provided to the telephone company.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The REN is used to determine the number of devices you may legally connect to your telephone line. In most areas, the sum of the REN of all devices connected to one line must not exceed five (5.0). You should contact your telephone company to determine the maximum REN for your calling area.</FONT></p>

Be sure that the telephone line you are connecting the modem to is a standard analog line and not a digital (PBX ), party, or coin telephone line. If this device causes harm to the telephone network, the telephone company will notify you in advance that temporary discontinuance of service may be required. But, if advance notice is not practical, the telephone company will notify the customer as soon as possible. Also, you will be advised of your right to file a complaint with the FCC if you believe it is necessary.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The telephone company may make changes in its facilities, equipment, operations, or procedures that could effect the operation of the equipment. If this happens, the telephone company will provide advance notice in order for you to make necessary modifications to maintain uninterrupted service.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This digital apparatus does not exceed the Class B limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus set out in the interference-causing equipment standard entitled Digital Apparatus, ICES-003 of Industry Canada. Cet appareil num&eacute;rique respecte les limites de bruits radio-&eacute;lectriques applicables auxappareilsnum&eacute;riques de la Classe B pr&eacute;scrites dans la norme sur le materiel brouilleur: AppareilsNum&eacute;riques, NMB-003 &eacute;dict&eacute;e par l'Industrie Canada. The Industry Canada (IC) label identifies certified equipment. This certification means that the equipment meets certain telecommunications network protective, operation, and safety requirements. Industry Canada does not guarantee the equipment will operate to the users' satisfaction. Before installing this equipment, users should ensure that it is permissible to be connected to the facilities of the local telecommunications company. The equipment must also be installed using an acceptable method of connection. In some cases, the inside wiring associated with a single-line individual service may be extended by means of a certified connector assembly (telephone extension cord). The customer should be aware that compliance with the above conditions might not prevent degradation of service in some situations. Repairs to certified equipment should be made by an authorized Canadian maintenance facility designated by the supplier. Any repairs or alterations made by the user to this equipment, or equipment malfunctions, may give the telecommunications company cause to request the user to disconnect the equipment. Users should ensure for their own protection that the electrical ground connections of the power utility, telephone lines, and internal metallic water pipe system, if present, are connected together. This precaution may be particularly important in rural areas.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>CAUTION: </B>Users should not attempt to make electrical ground connections by themselves, but should contact the appropriate inspection authority or an electrician, as appropriate.</FONT></P>
